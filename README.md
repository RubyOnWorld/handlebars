# ruby-handlebars

Pure Ruby library for Handlebars templates.
The main goal of this library is to simplify the use of Ruby and Handlebars on Windows machine. If you do not have any need of working on Windows, take a look at [handlebars.rb](https://github.com/cowboyd/handlebars.rb) that uses the real Handlebars library.
